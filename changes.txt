In this commit what we did was to create a django project and app. 
We started by creating a virtual environment:
python -m venv env
If it is not activated, (you can check it out by looking at the left of the command line, it should be written the 
name of your environment in paranthesis, e.g. (env)), you can activate by running this command. 
env\Scripts\activate
This tutorial is for windows.
For Mac and Linux commands please check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django
We install django framework to the environment.
pip install django
We start the project
django-admin startproject tutorial_project .
This command is used to start the server. Run this in the folder where your manage.py file is in
python manage.py runserver
We start an app called tutorial_app. You can name the project and the app anything you want.
python manage.py startapp tutorial_app

Step2:
Here we add out app to installed apps. Then, we create our initial page. 

Step3:
Here, we add two more urls and get query strings(parameters in url).

Step 4:
We create our html files, and connect our views to those files.

Step 5:
command to install crispy forms:
pip install django-crispy-forms 

Step 6:
List the tv shows

Step 7:
pip install mysqlclient
